## About the project
Gateway is a simple 2D platformer with different mechanics that you will unlock as you play through the levels.
It's my first project done with Unity and it's been developed over 3 weeks. The game is heavily inspired by the level from
Geometry Dash "Gateway" by VYP.

## Game design document
Before programming, it's important to have a clear idea and put it on paper to know if the project can work.
To plan it, a game design document (GDD) is usually created, you can find it in this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uVLHpd2P8sOpjQJx_6X1ru_B_Sr4UdAhdVTYPcLSNmc/edit?usp=sharing).

## User guide
To learn a little more about how to play Gateway, I've prepared this [user guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VzeLPucojnIfp87h6c1S3RwPgGh4M7YCPzvFsccHLtA/edit?usp=sharing).
